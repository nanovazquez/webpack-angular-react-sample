## Webpack - Angular - React sample

### TODO

1. Include component styles in bundle. 
2. Check, test & demonstrate on demand loading of each component.
3. Remove all component initialization from `index.html`
4. Add routing to main `index.js` file, using `React` and check if it can live with components' routing logic. 
5. Propose a way to centralize routing (and bootstrap each component routing logic)
5. Add angular2 and react component with routing.

### Setup
1. Run the following script

  ```
  npm install
  npm run build
  npm run serve
  ```
